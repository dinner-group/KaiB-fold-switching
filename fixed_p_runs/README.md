# Fixed proline simulations

Simulations with prolines fixed in a single isomerization state (cis or trans).
These use the old single-well (harmonic) potential in the Upside engine.
Use the `-p` flag in the `run_md3.py` script to specify how to change
the initial isomerization states of the prolines (P63, P70, P71, and P72).

cis_gs and trans_fs are using D91R mutant
